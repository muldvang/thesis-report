\chapter{Implementation}

This chapter describes the important aspects of the implementation. As this
thesis is intended as being an extension of the work made by
\citet{sand2013ziphmmlib} the code itself is also an extension of the zipHMM
library.

The library is written in C++ with bindings for R and Python. By the work made
in this thesis the library has been extended to include a more efficient
Viterbi implementation as well as bindings for R and Python.

\fxnote{The only difference to the original implementation is that the data
  structure constructed in the Forwarder class is moved to its own class DS.\@ The
  Forwarder class as well as the new Viterbi class both aggregate a DS.}
