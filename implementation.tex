\chapter{Implementation}

This chapter describes the important aspects of the implementation. As this
thesis is intended as being an extension of the work made by
\citet{sand2013ziphmmlib} the code itself is also an extension of the zipHMM
library.

The library is written in C++ with bindings for R and Python. By the work made
in this thesis the library has been extended to include a more efficient
Viterbi implementation as well as bindings for R and Python.
