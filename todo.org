* Experiments
- Compute the running time of the different stages to see how the running time
  behave as well as see where to optimize.
- Make an experiment using the new Viterbi implementation but without
  compressing the sequence. I guess this is faster than the simple
  Viterbi. Hopefully it is slower than the compressed one. Test with both
  backtracking enabled and disabled.

* Report
- Discuss when to use Viterbi without backtracking. Make reference to the
  thesis Storm was censor at.
- Remember to argue that N << T. Hence, the N^3 factor is not that bad compared
  to the typical very large T.

* Code
- Seems to segfault sometimes.
