* General
- Other compressing schemes? Using e.g. Lempel-Ziv might make it possible to
  speed up posterior decoding as explained by Lifshits, but it might be unlikely.
- Parallelize algorithms? By this a speed up could be gained in posterior decoding.
- How the parallelization made by Andreas Sand work? How does this compare to Lifshifts?

* Experiments
- How many times should we use the compressed sequence to make the compression
  affordable?
- Experiments with backward to ensure the speedup.
- Experiments with forward to make sure that it is as fast as the original.

* Report
- Discuss when to use Viterbi without backtracking. Make reference to the
  thesis Storm was censor at.
- Remember to argue that N << T. Hence, the N^3 factor is not that bad compared
  to the typical very large T.
