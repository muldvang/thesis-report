\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my supervisor Christian N.\ S.\ Pedersen for help,
guidance, and discussions that have been of great value for this project. For
proof reading the thesis and for discussions of problems thanks go to Dan
Søndergaard and Johan Sigfred Abildskov. Thanks to Mads Fabricius Schmidt for
being a pleasant office buddy and making me meet at the office (almost) every
morning.

My six years at the university has been impacted by many people. Thanks to Dan
Søndergaard with whom I have spent hundreds of hours working on projects,
preparing for exams, cooking meals and drinking beers. Thanks to Christian N.\
S.\ Pedersen for some great courses making me interested in bioinformatics and
machine learning. And lastly, thanks to all student organizations, especially
\TKET{}, for making the university a very enjoyable place to be.
